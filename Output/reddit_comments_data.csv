1n5n1rf,Trump faces returning $100bn in tariffs after court ruling,politics,nbtsxgp,"This is next-level corruption. Howard Lutnick, the current Commerce Secretary, is a key figure in pushing for these tariffs. At the same time, his sons who are now running his old company, Cantor Fitzgerald, are creating a financial product to profit from the tariffs.

The scheme works like this:
1.  Small businesses get hit with massive tariffs that they can't afford to wait years to get back through the courts.

2.  Cantor Fitzgerald offers to buy their right to a future refund for a small percentage of the value (around 20-30 cents on the dollar).

3.  If a court overturns the tariffs, Cantor Fitzgerald gets the full refund from the government, making a huge profit.

Essentially, the Lutnicks are profiting from a policy that their family is directly involved in creating, while simultaneously taking advantage of the financial desperation it causes for other businesses. It's a textbook case of profiting from the public trust. The father creates the chaos with tariffs, and the sons swoop in to feast on the wreckage, paying pennies on the dollar for what the government owes. It's a ghoulish, predatory strategy where they profit from both the policy and the ruin it creates for everyone else.

This is what happens when you elect people without an iota of integrity to office. And nothing is going to change until lawmakers have business interests. It's a vicious cycle.

Edit: I received a DM from a MAGA supporter saying that tariffs are necessary to recover revenue from Obama's ""secret trade deals"". I'm not sure how I even respond to that.",1,aaryan_a,2025-09-01 07:37:16

Republicans complain about voter fraud and stolen elections but then try to do voter fraud and steal elections. Christians back Trump despite him being a horrible and immoral person. Conservatives back him despite him massively raising the deficit. Military people back him despite him saying soldiers who die are losers. Republicans as a whole seem to have given up on fair elections and democracy despite invading the Middle East 20 years ago to ""spread democracy"".

And that's without mentioning all the alternative facts, denialism, conspiracy theories, lies, misinformation etc that they're constantly putting out and believing. Don't get me started on flat earthers.
