Republicans complain about voter fraud and stolen elections but then try to do voter fraud and steal elections. Christians back Trump despite him being a horrible and immoral person.

Republicans as a whole seem to have given up on fair elections and democracy despite invading the Middle East 20 years ago to ""spread democracy"".

1n44i2q,JB Pritzker Just Set Himself Apart From All Other Democrats,politics,nbi7ufn,""" He has firmly planted himself in the same ‚Äúfighter‚Äù lane as California Governor Gavin Newsom‚Äîthe better to distinguish himself from, say, whatever it is that Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer thinks she‚Äôs been doing lately.""

""Pritzker ended up being the headline figure of that Monday news conference, thanks to the simplicity and directness   of his message. *‚ÄúMr. President, do not come to Chicago,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou are neither wanted here nor needed here.‚Äù* He offered some satisfying digs at the evident decline of Trump‚Äôs mental faculties. He hit many of the right notes for someone who wants to establish himself as a leader of a dissident movement. But Pritzker saved his best for last, when he promised to take the fight against Trump a step farther than most Democrats have allowed themselves.""

*"" Finally, to the Trump administration officials who are complicit in this scheme, to the public servants who have forsaken their oath to the Constitution to serve the petty whims of an arrogant little man, to any federal official who would come to Chicago and try to incite my people into violence as a pretext for something darker and more dangerous: We are watching and we are taking names.""*

""This is where Pritzker has leveled up over his fellow Democrats, by promising a future of accountability and retribution for the destruction Trump and his minions are doing to the constitutional order and our individual freedoms. As I wrote back in May, the Trump White House and the GOP are no longer a political party by any definition; rather, they are a sort of criminal syndicate with an extensive portfolio of white collar crimes, violent offenses against our civil rights, and an ongoing sort of imposed cultural tyranny that is killing off the well-paying jobs of the future by decimating academia, and literally sparking public health crises at home and abroad through the Lysenkoism of key administration figures like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.""

‚ÄúThere is a certain necessary logic to what has to follow corrupt misrule of this kind: tribunals, trials, punishment, prison, and the running to ground and defunding of the entire Trump syndicate.‚Äù The only thing we were lacking then was an ambitious political figure who was willing to say that they were ready and willing to make accountability a key plank in their platform. Pritzker has made a timely arrival.""

""As Discourse Blog‚Äôs Rafi Schwartz points out, this isn‚Äôt the only uniquely consequential aspect of Pritzker‚Äôs speech. The Illinois governor‚Äîchanneling the feelings of so many who‚Äôve forewarned of what was to come in a second Trump term‚Äîtold those assembled, *‚ÄúIf it sounds to you like I am alarmist, that is because I am ringing an alarm, one that I hope every person listening will heed, both here in Illinois and across the country.‚Äù*

""And it sure sounds like Pritzker wants to put his hands to the task right now.*‚ÄúIf you hurt my people,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúnothing will stop me, not time or political circumstance, from making sure that you face justice under our constitutional rule of law.‚Äù*

""In a week where Beltway Democrats passed their time pointlessly debating whether or not they were using words like ‚Äúfood insecurity‚Äù too much, and congratulating each other for calling the D.C. occupation a ‚Äústunt‚Äù or a ‚Äúdistraction,‚Äù hearing a Democratic politician speak in plain English is pleasingly bracing. These are, indeed, encouraging words to hear after Democrats long implored us to ‚Äúlook forward, not backward‚Äù and allowed misrule to go unpunished, thereby paving the road for Trump‚Äôs fascist second act.""",1556,ChiGuy6124,2025-08-30 10:29:38

Furthermore, it is *profoundly* ironic that posters are heckling me about ""leftist purity tests"" while interrogating me about whether I voted for Hillary/Biden/Harris in the past and if I would do something similar again. Please remove the logs from your own eyes. **If you had a choice between Trump/Vance, and a Dem candidate whose only priority was halting aid to Israel, what would you do?** *That's how ridiculous you sound.*

That's the same ""vote blue no matter who"" energy that we're lambasting in the NYC mayoral race. Be better than Hakeem Jeffries. We shouldn't *need* to choose between a shit sandwich and a hole in the head, *which is why primaries are important.*  
\---------------------

\*I'm not a resident of Illinois.\*

I *REALLY* hope that Pritzker is intending to run in 2028. He's way less slimy than Gavin Newsom. Despite being a billionaire himself, he's apparently a class traitor in the style of FDR.

Newsom dominates the stage right now, but the primary hasn't even officially started, and the election is over 3 years away. There's plenty of time for more figures to emerge in opposition to MAGA and fascism. And plenty of time for people to realize that Newsom will throw anybody under the bus to get into the Oval Office.
